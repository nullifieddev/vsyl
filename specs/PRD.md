### **Document 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project:** The Unapologetic Sanctuary - Edurne Ferrero Blog & Editorial Platform
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 24, 2023
**Author:** Atelier (AI Design & Development Lead)

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the complete redesign of the Edurne Ferrero web presence. The project consists of two core components: a public-facing, multi-lingual blog website, and a private, role-based content creation studio.

The project's guiding philosophy is **"The Unapologetic Sanctuary."** It must be a digital experience that is calm, confident, authentic, and deeply reflective of Edurne Ferrero's "Vive Salvaje y Libre" mantra and the "Equinox Philosophy" of balance.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **For the Reader:** To provide a serene, immersive, and fast reading experience that allows them to connect deeply with Edurne's content.
*   **For Edurne (The Author):** To radically simplify the content creation process, removing all technical friction and enabling her to create and manage content effortlessly from her mobile device.
*   **For the Editor:** To establish a clear, efficient, and professional workflow for translating, editing, and publishing content.
*   **For the Brand:** To create a timeless, unique, and authentic digital presence that is a true extension of Edurne's identity, differentiating her from the conventional coaching market.

### 3. User Personas

*   **The Reader:** An individual seeking clarity, empowerment, and a more authentic life. They are introspective, appreciate quality, and are fluent in either English or Spanish.
*   **Edurne (The `Autor`):** The primary content creator. Prolific, creative, and a self-described technophobe. Her primary digital tool is her mobile phone.
*   **The Editor (The `Editor`):** Responsible for the English translation, final edits, and publishing management. Requires an efficient, clear workflow, likely on a desktop computer.
